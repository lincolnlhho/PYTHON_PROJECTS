# PYTHON_PROJECTS

This respository includes some of my personal projects I have created over the years. 
Some are older and may not be very neat, but it documents my journey to becoming a better programmer.
My main focus is on Data Analytics with python, but I enjoy the occasional coding challenge.

Some of the files require data in excel spreadsheets which I have not uploaded due to confidential reasons and will not run without them.

All of the projects in this respository are written in python. 
Have a nice day!
